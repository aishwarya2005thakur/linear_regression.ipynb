Our primary objective while using linear regression is to locate the best-fit line, which implies that the error between the predicted and actual values should be kept to a minimum. There will be the least error in the best-fit line.
The best Fit Line equation provides a straight line that represents the relationship between the dependent and independent variables. The slope of the line indicates how much the dependent variable changes for a unit change in the independent variable(s).
